<p>GitHub offers a cloud-based development environment called <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codespaces</a>. When launching a Codespace from a repository, it launches a virtual machine with the repository's code, allowing you to use and develop the code in your browser. The Codespace itself is run on GitHub's servers and uses a version of Linux for its operating system.</p>

<p>By default, opening a Codespace will open a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) interface in the browser, allowing you to edit, run, and debug your code just like you would locally on your own computer. This will contain a copy of the files from the repository that you can edit within the codespace without affecting the original repository until you decide to propagate your changes back to the repository.</p>

<p>Codespaces are highly customisable, allowing you to configure installing programs and extensions, installing extensions in VS Code. Much of this can be pre-defined, allowing anyone using the Codespace to use the same environment. This can reduce the need for complex setup processes when collaborating, or sharing code.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Codespaces are free to use up a limit of 60 hours per month by default. GitHub offers additional hours and features through paid plans. When opening a Codespace you will need to be signed into your GitHub account and the usage will count toward your limit (rather than the owner of the repository).</p>

<p>When opening a Codespace, it will remain Active while you have the tab open and a short time after closing the tab. This means the Codespace is still running on GitHub's server. In this state, it can be reopened quickly. When a Codespace becomes inactive its files, including any changes you have made, will be saved on GitHub's servers, allowing you to reopen the Codespace later. By default, an inactive Codespace will be deleted after 30 days. If you want to keep your changes in a Codespace you should download it to your own computer or propagate the changes to a GitHub repository.</p>
